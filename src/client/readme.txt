partsentry-digikey.py allows you to enter inventory items into the database from the command line using a keyboard or a barcode scanner. Mouser bags have both quantity and manufacturer partnumber as barcode, very nice. In the scanner directory is a helper file so you can scan the command './partsentry-digikey.py' without typing it. also has Y and n scans to help with question ack.
