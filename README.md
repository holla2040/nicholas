A tiny electronic parts ERP system for circuit designers who use CadSoft Eagle.

Here's a tiny ERP system that manages electronic part inventory in a database. There are tools to enter part count from the command line and web interface, single page webapp for inventory browsing, integration with eagle to query part availablity and bom level subtraction from part count during builds.

Using the project should decrease circuit design workflow time by decreasing part selection and inventory level management time.
